Early detection of skin lesions can help in its treatment and improve life. Most melanomas are ﬁrst identiﬁed visually, but unaided visual inspection only has a diagnostic accuracy of roughly 60%. Recently, medical professionals have used dermoscopy, a new technology of visual inspection, that both magniﬁes the skin and eliminates surface reﬂection.
These enhanced images help the dermatologist to diagnose melanoma more accurately. However, those human accuracy is about 65% to 75%.
With the rapid development of computer vision techniques, especially in the ﬁeld of deep learning, many Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in image classiﬁcation and detection. It is well acknowledged that CNNs show excellent performance in classifying images and achieve higher accuracy than many traditional methods.
Our proposed solution is to use the deep learning based models to help us in the skin cancer classification task and we would like to classify the most common skin cancers into 7 different classes.
